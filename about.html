                I'm from a small town outside of Grand Rapids, Michigan called Lowell, and I graduated from Lowell High School in 2018. While there I played baseball my freshman year, and starting my sophomore year there I ran cross country and track the next three years. I'm currently studying Computer Science at MSU, and I plan on graduating in December of 2021 with my bachelor's degree as well as a minor in mathematics. Outside of school, I love playing and watching sports with my friends or by myself, particularly disc golf and hockey. I've rooted for the Detroit Red Wings my entire life, and over quarantine one of my friends got me hooked on disc golf, so now I watch every major tournament and play as much as I can. I also enjoy running, weightlifting, and kayaking. Some of my other interests include mobile app development, reading about history, and playing videogames. I also have two dogs (Molly and Delta) and two cats (Cocoa and Jack), as well as a younger brother named Will.

                I've had internships at the following companies where I've been fortunate to do software development:

                <ul>
                    <li>Humana</li>
                    <li>Matrix: Center for Digital Humanities & Social Sciences</li>
                    <li>Autocam Inc.</li>
                </ul>
        
            <p>
                This summer I was fortunate to be able to have an internship with Humana in a virtual environment, and I'm just as fortunate that they allowed me to continue working for them part-time. This summer I worked on a project to add a new feature to their MyHumana Android app. What my team and I did was develop a proof of concept to enhance the Provider Finder functionality in the app to display the contents of search results for healthcare providers and pharmacies in a Google Maps fragment rather than in a list like the app currently does. We also added in functionality to order an Uber or a Lyft from the app using deeplink buttons to take the user from the MyHumana app to the respective app. The project was a huge hit, and during my team's final presentation we had numerous questions about when it would be released.

                Last school year, I worked for Matrix which is part of the Humanities Department here at MSU. They develop web applications for different humanities research projects that MSU sponsors. While there, I updated several sites to a new standard of PHP, and I wrote code to update the site to a new standard for the database they used.

                During my time at Autocam in the summer following my senior year of high school, I wrote VBA scripts to scrub data about different parts that were being manufactured from Excel sheets and output it into a new format that could then be uploaded to an internal website to view the data. This was particularly challenging since the data was from a branch that had just been absorbed into the company, so their data was in a relatively different format that wasn't exactly organized. I also did some work for them creating automated tests using a tool called Browserstack which were to be applied to a new website they were launching in Europe.
