                Today I went to the library with my girlfriend, Breann. It was nice being able to get out of my room since I've had to study there due to MSU closing the library until recently. She also brought her Leader Dog named Xoey, which she's training to be a seeing-eye dog for people who have a visual impairment. While I was at the library, I worked on this website, and I also listened to my lecture for my mobile application development class, CSE 476. I also dropped off my Spartan Spit kit since it was due today, and I drank an Arnold Palmer while I was there. I was able to create both pages for my blog, and I also wrote a decent chunk of content for my main page. The most important thing I did there through was optimize my fantasy football player and put a new wide receiver on my roster. When I left the library, the weather was amazing though other than it being a little too windy. It was great to feel the sun on my face though after having a few dreary weeks with a lot of rain and wind. I made sure to take the long way back due to the nice weather though.
